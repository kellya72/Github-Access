# Github-Access

Used plotly package in r to produce a scatterplot of number of commits and number of followers for users who are members of organisations 
and the first hundred users in r. My goal was to see if those who are in organisations had more followers and committed more that a random sample of the gitHub population. I also wanted to see if there was any correlation between number of commits and number of followers. 

From graphing the data I can see no indication that those in organisations have more followers or commits than the first hundred users. There was also a weak positive correlation between commithttps://plot.ly/organize/homes and followers. 

Here is a link to my plotly profile which contains my graphs: https://plot.ly/~aoifekelly
